## I. Data set:
- Downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Automobile
- Show pricings of various cars, along with their characteristics such as car company, horse power, engine type, etc.

## II. Main goals:
- Perform data cleaning and construct predictive models (Linear Regression & Random Forest) to estimate different car prices
- Control for multi-collinearity issues using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and avoid over-fitting models
- Examine the influences that different predictors have on car pricings 
- Evaluate models' predictive performances by comparing number of features used, R-squared, adjusted R-squared, RMSE, and MAPE 

## III. Files shared:
- CarPrice_Predictions.rmd: the R Markdown file containing codes to knit a .pdf report
- CarPrice_Predictions.pdf: the .pdf output from the .rmd file that shows the comprehensive analysis & report
- CarPrice_Data.csv: the data set used in this project
- CarPrice_Dictionary.xlsx: the descriptions for each variable in the data set
